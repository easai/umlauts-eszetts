# umlauts

German umlauts and eszett can be represented in ASCII as ae, ue, oe, and ss. While they can conveniently express German words without diacritical marks, they can be ambiguous. For example, Aether is not the same as Ã„ther. 

Here a Python script that generates all possible combinations of a German word with umlauts and eszett replaced by their ASCII equivalents (ae, oe, ue, ss).

### Usage
